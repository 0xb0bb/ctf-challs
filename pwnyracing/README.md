# Pwny.Racing Challenges

![Pwny.Racing](img/pwnyracing.png?raw=true)

I once made some challenges for a thing called `pwny.racing` and I asked
some respected hackers to join in the fun racing some simple (low reversing)
challenges.

Here is a collection of challenges I made during it's run. I have decided
not to release the community challenges that were slight variations of
previous challenges because they are not that interesting.

Feel free to use these as inpiration or just plain steal them for your own
CTF. If you want to be a cool person you can give me partial credit but it
is not required. Hopefully someone out there learns something from some of
these.

For anyone interested the most "borrowed" challenge ideas from this series
were [chall04](pwnyracing/chall04/) and [chall03](pwnyracing/chall03/).
